**Definition:** Open data refers to any content information or data that people are free to use, reuse and redistribute without any legal technological or social restriction.

## 10 requirements for true open data
- **Completeness**: Cannot upload a biased dataset, not complete
- **Privacy**: You cannot recycle data
- **Timelessness**: Should be available in a timely fashion
- **Ease of physical and electronic access**: for example not as a pdf
- **Machine readable**: widely used formats
- **Non-discrimination**: Anyone can access the data
- **Commonly owned or open standards**: No restrictive technology necessary
- **Licensing**: Be able to reuse and redistribute
- **Permanence**: Available online at any time
- **Usage costs**: No high costs that prevents people to use them

## The Shell (Backx) model of open data

>[!info]- The Shell model
>1. **Known**: Data are findable or at least their existence can be confirmed with the help of common tools, such as Web search engines, catalogues or Freedom of Information requests. Highly restricted data (Government or commercial secrets), undocumented data, or unfindable data are not known and thus are totally out of the public reach.  
>2. **Legally attainable**: When the data are not restricted by way of statutory enactments they can be classified  as legally attainable. If the data contain sensitive information, such as personal data, defence and trade  secrets, the governing legislations aim to mitigate such risks. Unless the related risks are mitigated, these  kinds of data (at least in raw form) cannot be legally obtained and are beyond the public domain. Further, it  is pointed out that physical/ digital access to legally attainable data is not always guaranteed.  
>3. **Accessible**: Accessibility refers to the physical aspect of attainability. It refers to both the physical mode  (via post) for records in soft/ hard format and digital modes (APIs, bulk download facilities) of access for  cloud or local computer databases. Universally accessible data implies that the data are publicly accessible, irrespective of the cost and usage restrictions, e.g. an API that is publicly accessible, which may/ may not be priced. 
>4. **Affordable**: Refers to financial attainability and part of the second shell of Backx’s model. Data that are  available free of charge are universally affordable. The data provider bears the cost from other revenue  sources, such as the organisation’s general annual budget in case of open government data. Despite the  ongoing emphasis on open data, the commercialisation of proprietary data is growing. However, if the user  costs of the data remain small, it can also be affordable at large.
>5. **Usable**: Usability is a multi-faceted character that refers to the ease of use, quality of the data and end-use  restrictions. Ease of use increases with machine readability and their compatibility with open-source tools.  Structured datasets offer high usability, whereas it is more cumbersome to process unstructured data (e.g.,  pdf, scanned documents). Data quality attributes such as timeliness and consistency affect the data  usability. Re-use of data implies usage by someone other than the original user for a different purpose. Certain licenses such as CC-BY-NC restrict the application of the to only non-commercial purposes.
>6. **Distributable**: This refers to the right to re-publish or share the data in an original or modified version with  a third party, without any or minor restrictions. This implies that the data come with a suitable license that  allows redistribution. The extent of distribution freedom depends on the specific licenses, e.g. distribution in  the adapted or original format. Examples of open data conformant licenses are Creative Commons (CC0,  CC-BY-4.0, CC-BY-SA-4.0), Open Data Commons, Open Database License ODbL1.0.

#### Creative common licenses
Creative Common Licenses are Open Licenses that classify how open data are based on four conditions. Opendk license is comparable to CC-BY, one of the highest degree of openness.

- **Attribution**: Others can copy, distribute, display, perform and remix your work if they credit your name as requested by you
- **No derivative works**: Other can only copy, distribute, display or perform verbatim copies of your work.
- **Share alike**: Others can distribute your work only under a license identical to the one you have chosen for your work
- **Non-commercial**: Others can copy, distribute, display, perform or remix your work but for non-commercial purposes only.
