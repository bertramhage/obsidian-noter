## Best subset selection
Looking at all possible submodels.

The procedure is as follows
1. Denote the first model $M_0$. This is the model with an intercept only
2. FOr $k=1,2,\dots, p$
	1. Estimate all $\begin{pmatrix}p \\ k\end{pmatrix}$ with exactly $k$ predictors
	2. Choose best among these models based on $RSS$ or $R^2$
3. This gives $p+1$ models. Choose the best among these using cross validation, AIC, BIC or adjusted $R^2$.

## Forward selection
The procedure is as follows
1. Denote the first model $M_0$. This is the model with an intercept only
2. For $\mathrm{k}=1,2, \ldots, \mathrm{p}-1$
	1. Estimate all $p-k$ models that add one predictor to $M_k$
	2. Choose the best among these models based on RSS or $R^2$
3. This gives $p+1$ models. Choose the best among these using cross validation, AIC, BIC or adjusted $R^2$.

## Other methods
- Backwards selection: start with all $p$ predictors, remove on at a time
- Hybrid approaches: Any combination of forward and backwards selection
