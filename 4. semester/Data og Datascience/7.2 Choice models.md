## Multinomial logit model
Also known as the logit model or MNL

A discrete choice model gives the probabilities for each alternative conditional on explanatory variables, i.e. $P(i|x_n)$.

The choice probabilities of the most commonly applied discrete choice model are
$$
P(i|x_n)=\frac{\exp(V(x_{ni}))}{\sum_j\exp(V(x_{nj}))}
$$
where $V(x_{nj})$ are the functions of the explanatory variables related to alternative $j$, also known as utility functions.

## Random utility maximization (RUM)
Suppose an individual with rational preferences makes choices from a choice set, J. Then it can be shown that the alternatives in the choice set can be represented by utility functions $U_j$ such that the probability of a specific choice is equal to the probability of the utility being the maximum utility, i.e
$$
P(i|x)=P(U_j>U_j \forall j\neq i)
$$
## Choice modelling using discrete choice models

We can model the demand for a given population using probabilities.

We see the demand for an alternative as the sum of probabilities over individuals in the population.

If a person has probability $P_{ni}$ to choose alternative $i$, then we get
$$
N_i=\sum_{n\in Pop}P_{ni}=N\cdot \frac{1}{N}\cdot \sum_{n\in Pop}P_{ni}=N\cdot \bar{P_{i}}  \, 
$$
## Marginal utilities
The marginal utility in a discrete choice model is defined as
$$
MU_{x_k}^i=\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x_k}.
$$
