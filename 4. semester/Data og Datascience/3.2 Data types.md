## Data classification
#### Cross section
**One time, multiple individuals/units**
Data where we have observation that are not related through unobserved factors

+ Such data can be modeled using linear regression, lasso and ridge regression, logistic regression and other types of classical models
+ For example: one day travel diaries, wage data, etc.

#### Time series
**One individual/unit, at multiple times**
Data where we have many observations from the *same individual or unit* so there is definitely a relation between observations
![[Skærmbillede 2024-02-14 kl. 15.05.31.png|400]]
+ Such data can bed modeled using linear regression with serial correlation, time-series models, specific neural networks and other types of models that do take the correlation into account.
+ For example: One year travel diary for one person, GDP for one country over many years, etc.
#### Panel
**Same units observed $t$ times**
Data where we have several observations from the same individual or unit so there is definitely a relation between observations.

+ Such data can be modeled using panel versions of linear regression, specific types of neural networks, and other types of models that do take the panel correlation into account.

## Data types

**Observational data** are registrations of something that happens in the real world.

**Stated preference (SP)** is a common word used in social sciences for *hypothetical* data related to choices.
