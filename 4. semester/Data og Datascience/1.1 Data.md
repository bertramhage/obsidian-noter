### Learning from data

(1) Data $\to$ (2) Sample $\to$ (3) Study population
1. (1) Data $\to$ (2) Sample
	- Here we need to be sure that we measure in data for the sample are:
		- **Reliable**, ie having a **low variability** in repeated studies
		- **Valid**, ie being a measure of what we **actually** want to measure and hence avoid systematic biases
2. (2) Sample $\to$ (3) Study population
	- The question is whether the results we obtain from the sample represents results we would get from the population, ie do the study have **internal validity**. To ways to obtain this:
		- **Random sampling**, ie choosing element at random from the study population to include in the sample
		- Using the **full population** as sample, eg if you have a small population or if you have access to the full population
3. (3) Study population $\to$ (4) Target population
	- The question is whether we can actually study the target population.
	- A main problem here is if the study population is now and the target population is the future or a scenario.

>[!info] Types of sampling
>**Random**
>	- You try to draw at random for study population
>	
>**Exogenous**
>	- You divide the study population into groups and try to draw at random within each group eg the sampling of DTUs travel behavior survey stratifies on gender, age and geography
>	- If done correctly it can reduce sampling costs
>	
>**Endogenous**
>	- You divide the study population into strata based on the endogenous  variable of interest, e.g. to get information about electric vehicles we  might sample 50% non-EV owners and 50% EV owners. This will create issues in estimation procedures that sometimes can be solved

>**Misc**
>	- All other sampling procedures
