## Linearity
Linearity is checked by plotting residuals vs. predicted or residuals vs. each explanatory variable
Are the residuals evenly spread around 0?

## Non-constant variance
Are the bounds of the residual plots even

Non-constant variance can sometimes be solved by transformation of the dependent variable or one of the explanatory variables.

## Correlation of error terms
When observations are dependent across individuals, time or space

**Example**: Time series data
**Example**: Attributes seen over certain geographical areas

Can potentially be mitigated by introducing dummy variables, for example for categories of geo location

## Outliers
Points that are special in the **outcome** dimension, Y variable

![[Pasted image 20240410141150.png]]
A matrix used to find outliers is the hat matrix
$$
H = X(X^\top X)^{-1}X^\top
$$
so $\hat{Y}=HY$ and the residuals are given by $e=(I-H)Y$.

Cook's distance measure
$$
D_i = \frac{e_i^2}{p(MSE)} \frac{h_{ii}}{(1-h_{ii})^2}
$$
## High-leverage points
Points that are special in the **input** space, X variables

## Multiple regression - multicollinearity
Strong correlation among explanatory variables.

**Examples:**
+ Diesel and fuel efficiency for cars
+ Weight, horse power and motor size for cars
+ GDP, population and jobs in a zone
+ Travel time and cost between zones

Can lead multiple signs on some of the coefficients

###### Variance inflation factor (VIF)
An indicator for multicollinearity.
This is the ratio of the variance of $\hat{\beta}_j$ when fitted in the full model over the variance of $\hat{\beta}_j$ when fitted in simply model with only $x_j$.
Rule of thumb: Above 5 should raise concerns

#### What to do:
+ Remove one of the problematic variables
+ Make linear combinations of the problematic variables

## Potential problems checklist

- Consider whether you linear regression makes sense
- Consider whether there could be - correlation among error terms - what is you observation unit?
- Check linearity and non-constant variances using residual plots. You decide whether you use residuals or standardised residuals
- Check if any observations are outliers or high-leverage points from residual plots or leverage plots
- Only remove observations if you have solid reasons to do so.
- Check if multicollinearity is an issue using either a correlation matrix or VIF scores
- Only use QQ-plots if it important for you application that error terms are normally distributed.
