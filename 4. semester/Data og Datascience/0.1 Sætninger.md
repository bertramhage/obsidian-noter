## Data

>[!info] Types of sampling
>**Random**
>	- You try to draw at random for study population
>	
>**Exogenous**
>	- You divide the study population into groups and try to draw at random within each group eg the sampling of DTUs travel behavior survey stratifies on gender, age and geography
>	- If done correctly it can reduce sampling costs
>	
>**Endogenous**
>	- You divide the study population into strata based on the endogenous  variable of interest, e.g. to get information about electric vehicles we  might sample 50% non-EV owners and 50% EV owners. This will create issues in estimation procedures that sometimes can be solved
>	
>**Misc**
>	- All other sampling procedures

>[!info] Covariance
>For a population the covariance between two variables, $X,Y$ is:
>$$
>\sigma_{X,Y}=\frac{1}{N_{Pop}}\sum_{j}^{N} (X_j-\mu_X)(Y_j-\mu_Y) \, 
>$$
>
>For a sample, the covariance between to variables, $X,Y$ is:
>$$
>\sigma_{X,Y}=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j}^{N} (X_j-\bar{X})(Y_j-\bar{Y}) \, 
>$$

>[!info] Correlation
>Two random variables, $X,Y$, with variances $V(X), V(Y)$ have correlation
>$$
>\rho(X,Y)=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{ V(X)V(Y) }}
>$$
>For a population, the correlation between two variables, $X, Y$ is:
>$$
>\rho_{X,Y}=\frac{\sigma_{X,Y}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}
>$$
>For a sample, the correlation between two variables >$X,Y$ is:
>$$
>\rho_{X,Y}=\frac{\sigma_{X,Y}}{s_Xs_Y}
>$$

>[!info] Pearson correlation coefficient
>The most common version of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient is:
>$$
>\rho(X,Y)=\frac{\sum_i(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{ \sum_i(x_i-\bar{x})^2\sum_i(y_i-\bar{y})^2 }}
>$$

>[!info] Spearman rank correlation coefficient
>For ordinally scaled variables, it is more correct to use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient:
>$$
>SR(X,Y)=\frac{\sum_i(rx_i-\bar{rx})(ry_i-\bar{ry})}{\sqrt{ \sum_i(rx_i-\bar{rx})^2\sum_i(ry_i-\bar{ry})^2 }}
>$$
