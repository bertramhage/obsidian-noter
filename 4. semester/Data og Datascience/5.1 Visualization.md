## Key principles
- Crystal clear key message
	- When youâ€™re trying to show too much data at once you may end up not showing anything
- Know your audience
	- Your audience:
		- ... doesn't know the data
		- ... doesn't not the underlying work
		- ... have never seen the figure before
	+ Help the reader
+ Visualization buildup
	+ If going for complexity, build up slowly
+ Avoid repetition
	+ When preparing a presentation or report, aim to use a different type of visualization for each distinct analysis.
