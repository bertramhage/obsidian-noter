## Interactions
A linear regression model can be extended to include interactions of the x variables:
>[!example]+ Annual income
>$$
>y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+u
>$$
>Continuous interaction
>$$
>Y_{income}=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{age}+\beta_2X_{experience}+\beta_3X_{age}\cdot X_{experience}+\epsilon_i
>$$

###### Hierarchical principle
We keep main effects even when they are insignificant if we have added interactions

## Transformations

>[!example]+ Annual income
>$$
>y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+u
>$$
>$$
>Y_{income}=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_{age} + \beta_2(X_{age})^2+\beta_3X_{experience}+\epsilon_i
>$$
>$$
>\ln(Y_{commute})=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{gender}+\beta_2\ln(X_{income})+\epsilon_i
>$$

$ln(x)$ is used when large values of $x$ has a relative smaller effect
- e.g. an income change of 100,000 kr from 900,000 kr to 1,000,000 kr has a smaller effect than a change from 200,000 kr to 300,000 kr. if income is modelled using $\ln()$
