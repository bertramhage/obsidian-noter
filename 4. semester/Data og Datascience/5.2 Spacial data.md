## Inverse distance weighting (IDW)
Value at some point $P$ depends on the value at multiple nearby locations $Q$
The closer to $P$ the higher the weight

>[!info] Inverse distiance weighting

w_Q = \left( \frac{1}{d(P,Q)} \right)^\alpha.

>and $\alpha$  is a parameter controlling how fast the weights decay as a function of distance.
