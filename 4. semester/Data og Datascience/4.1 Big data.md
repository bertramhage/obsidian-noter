## Data classification
Data can be categorized by
- Big vs small
- Online, Real-time, Offline
	- Off-line, you collect historical data and use it to take action in the future
	- Real-time systems, used to deploy corrective actions. Constantly monitoring in order to take action. No delay is tolerated.
	- On-line systems, systems that are connected to the internet. Delay can be tolerated.
- Volunteer vs observed
	- Volunteer: an individual can *actively* (sometimes passively) contribute to the data collection. 
	- Observed: data about the individual are collected *passively*. 
- Private vs public ownership
	- Dictated by whom is involved during the data generation/production phase.
	- Individuals may also claim ownership of their own data. Eg. right to be forgotten.
	- Community sourced data, crowd sourced and owned, eg. open street map
