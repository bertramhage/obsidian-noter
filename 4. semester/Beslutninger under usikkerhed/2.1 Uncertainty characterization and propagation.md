### Uncertainty propagation and loss evaluation  
Given a deterministic model
$$
\min C(\mathbf{x}, \omega) \text{ s.t. } \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{A}_x
$$
, where $\omega$ is the uncertainty a single value $\hat{\omega}$ can be used (eg. forecast of the potential realization of $\omega$).

However, the solution $\mathbf{x}^*$ is only optimal if $\hat{\omega}$ realizes, which is unlikely.

>[!example]+ Example 1a: When to buy Christmas presents
>A rational father is to buy a Christmas present for his children
>He wants to buy them just on time
>Expected delivery time is $\hat{\omega} = 8$ days and it is currently dec. 14.
>
>$$
>\min C(x, \hat{\omega}) \text{ s.t. } x \in 14, \dots, 23 
>$$
>where
>$$
>C(x, \omega) =
>\begin{cases}
>\epsilon(d-(x+\omega)), d-(x+\omega)≥0 (\epsilon \text{ small, eg, } \epsilon=1) \\
>\gamma((x+\omega)-d), d-(x+\omega)≤0 (\gamma \text{ large, eg. } \gamma=4)
\end{cases}

### Scenarios and sample average approximation

>[!info] Definition: Sample Average Approximation (SAA)
>In an EUM framework, the sample average approximation of the stochastic optimization problem at hand is
>$$
>\min \sum_{k=1}^{N} p_kC(x, \omega_k), \text{ s.t. } x\in \mathcal{A}_x  \, 
>$$
>where $K$ is the number of samples considered, and $p_k$ their associated probability of occurence, $0≤p_k≤1, \sum_kp_k=1$.

>[!example]+ Example 1b: Solving using SAA
>We use Julia to approximate $p_k$, with $K=20$ and $K=1000$
>
>For $K=20$:
>$$
>C = 0.05C(x,6)+0.45C(x,7)+0.15C(x,8)+0.2C(x,9)+0.15C(x,10)
>$$
>We $min \text{ x}$:
![[Skærmbillede 2024-02-06 kl. 14.24.04.png|500]]
>thus $x^*=14$.

### Fallacy of averages
- It is not equivalent to consider:
	1. Minimization of the expected cost over $\omega$ and
	2. Minimization of the cost for the expected $\omega$.
