## Autoregressive (AR)
For a series $y_t$ the level of its current observations depends on the level of its *lagged* observations.
E.g. if we observe a high GDP realization this quarter, we would expect that the GDP in the next few quarters are good as well.

>\phi(B)=(1-\phi_1B - \phi_2B^2-\dots-\phi_pB^p)

## Moving average (MA)

The moving average term in a time series model is a past error (multiplied by a coefficient).
E.g. if we observe a negative shock to the economy we would expect this negative effect affects the economy not only for the time it takes place, but also for the near future.

>[!info] $MA(1)$
>The *moving average of order one* can be written as
>$$
>y_t = c+\epsilon_t+\theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} = c+\theta(B)\epsilon_t,
>$$
>where $\epsilon_t\sim iidN(0,\sigma_e^2)$ and $\theta(B)=(1+\theta_1B)$.

>[!info] $MA(q)$
>The *$q$'th order moving average model* is
>$$
>y_t = c+\epsilon_t+\theta_1\epsilon_{t-1}+\theta_2\epsilon_{t-2}+\dots+\theta_q\epsilon_{t-q} = c+\theta(B)\epsilon_t,
>$$
>where $\epsilon_t\sim iidN(0,\sigma_e^2)$ and $\theta(B)=(1+\theta_1B+\theta_2B^2+\dots+\theta_qB^q)$.

## ARMA model
$AR$: $\phi(B)y_t=c+\epsilon_t$
$MA$: $y_t=c+\theta(B)\epsilon_t$
$ARMA$: $\phi(B)y_t=c+\theta(B)\epsilon_t$

## ARIMA model
ARIMA combines differencing with autoregression and a moving average model.

>The full ARIMA model can be written as

>\underbrace{ (1-\phi_1B-\dots-\phi_pB^p) }_{ AR(p) }\underbrace{ (1-B)^d }_{ d \text{ diffs} }y_t=\underbrace{ c+(1+\theta_1B+\dots+\theta_qB^q) }_{ MA(q) }\epsilon_t

## Seasonal ARIMA
Denoted:
SARIMA $\underbrace{ (p,d,q) }_{ \text{Non-seasonal part} }\underbrace{ (P,D,Q)_m }_{ \text{Seasonal part} }$
where $m=$ number of periods per season.

Eg. an SARIMA$(1,1,1)(1,1,1)_4$ model (without a constant) for $m=4$:

>$MSE=$ sigma2$\_\eta$: Est: $28.1018$

## Evaluation
Good models are obtained by minimizing either the $AIC, AICc_c$ or $BIC$.

**Autocorrelation function (ACF)**: How much does $y_t$ depend on $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \dots$
