$\lambda _i$ and $\mu_i$ are rates of an exponential distribution and may be state dependent.

Examples:
- Birth: person joining queue
- Death: person leaving queue
- State dependent birth rates: long queue could turn people away
- State dependent death rates: smaller service rate

## Queueing systems as birth-and-death process
Denoted as 
Arrival distribution \\ Service time distribution \\ number of servers (\\ additional features)

**Examples**

|  | Arrivals | Service time | Servers | Additional features |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| M\\M\\1 | Poisson Process | Exponential | 1 | - |
| M\\M\\s | Poisson Process | Exponential | s | - |
| M\\M\\1\\K | Poisson Process | Exponential | s | max length of K, queue |
| M\\G\\s | Poisson Process | General distribution | s | - |
