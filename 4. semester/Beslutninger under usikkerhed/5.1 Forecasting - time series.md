**Time series** : A series of data points indexed in time order.
Frequently plotted via line charts where the x-axis is the time.

## Time series analysis
+ **Description**: summary statistics, plots and graphs analysis and 
+ **Interpretation**: find a model to describe the time dependence in the data, can we interpret the model? 
+ **Forecasting or prediction**: given a sample from a time series, forecast the next value, or the next few values

## Variation components
#### Trend component
Long-term change in the mean level.

![[Skærmbillede 2024-03-05 kl. 13.31.44.png|400]]
#### Seasonal component
Regular and predictable patterns that repeat over a specific period, such as a day, week, month, or season
![[Skærmbillede 2024-03-05 kl. 13.32.36.png|400]]
#### Cyclical component
Fluctuations occurring at irregular intervals longer than seasonal effects, often related to economic or business cycles.
#### Irregular/Random component
Unpredictable, random, residual fluctuations.

## Model selection
**Regression**: Models that use time indices as $x$-variables and find a linear relationships between time.
**Smoothing**: Models such as moving average and exponential smoothing.
**ARIMA**: (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models that relate the present value of a series to past values and past prediction errors.

## Evaluation
No method is superior to any other method in every context. The performance of a forecasting technique can be measured by the error produced over time.

## Modelling: Smoothing
#### Moving average method
This method averages the data for only the last $N$ periods as the forecast for the next period
$$
\hat{y}_{t_+1}=\sum_{i=t-N+1}^{t} \frac{y_i}{N} \, 
$$
#### Exponential smoothing
Exponential smoothing gives greater weight to more recent values, and the weights decrease *exponentially* as the series goes farther back in time.

###### Simple exponential smoothing
Simple exponential smoothing has a "flat" forecast function.
$$
\hat{y}_t=\alpha y_{t-1}+(1-\alpha)\hat{y}_{t-1}
$$
$$
\Leftrightarrow \hat{y}_t=\alpha y_{t-1} + (1+\alpha)(\alpha y_{t-2}+(1+\alpha)\hat{y}_{t-2})\Leftrightarrow \dots
$$
Initialize $\hat{y}_{0}$, e.g. like $\hat{y}_{0}=y_1$ (alt. $\hat{y}_{0}=\bar{y}$).

Lower values of $\alpha$ make the model more stable, but less responsive to changes in the process.

###### Double exponential smoothing (Holt's method)
The method uses two smoothing constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and two smoothing equations:
$$
\begin{cases}
L_t & =\alpha Y_t+(1+\alpha)(L_{t-1)}+B_{t-1}) & \text{(level equation)} \\
B_t & =\beta(L_t-L_{t-1})+(1-\beta)B_{t-1} & \text{(trend equation)}
\end{cases}
$$
where $0≤\alpha,\beta≤1$.

Initial $L_0$ and $B_0$ are needed to start the computation, $L_0=y_1$ and $B_0=y_2-y_1$.

Finally, $L_t$ and $B_t$ can be used to obtain a $\tau$-step ahead forecast, $\hat{Y}_{t+\tau,t}$, from period $t: \hat{Y}_{t+\tau,t}=L_t+\tau B_t$.
