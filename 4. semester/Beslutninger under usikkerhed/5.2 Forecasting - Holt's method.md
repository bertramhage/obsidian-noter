Also denoted *triple exponential smoothing*

The Holt-Winters seasonal method comprises the forecast equation and *three* smoothing equations: $L_t, B_t$ and $S_t$ (seasonal component)

Smoothing parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$

$m$ denotes the period of the seasonality, i.e., the number of seasons in a year.

#### Additive and multiplicative method

>[!info]+ Holt-Winters seasonal method (additive)
>**The series**:
>$$
>L_t = \alpha(Y_t-S_{t-m})+(1-\alpha)(L_{t-1}+B_{t-1})
>$$
>**The trend:**
>$$
>B_t=\beta(L_t-L_{t-1})+(1-\beta)B_{t-1}
>$$
>**Seasonal factors:**
>$$
>S_t = \gamma(Y_t-L_{t-1}-B_{t-1})+(1-\gamma)S_{t-m}
>$$
>The forecast made in period $t$ for any future period $t+\tau(\tau≤m)$ is given by:
>$$
>\hat{Y}_{t,t+\tau}=L_t+\tau B_t+S_{t-m+\tau_m},
>$$
>where $\tau_m=\lfloor (\tau-1) \mod m \rfloor +1$.

**Initialize** $S_0, S_{-1}, \dots, S_{-m-1}$ based on the data.
For additive method $\sum S_0, S_{-1}, \dots, S_{-m-1}=0$.
For multiplicative method $\sum S_0, S_{-1}, \dots, S_{-m-1}=m$
