>[!info] Stochastic process
>A stochastic process is an *indexed collection of random variables $X_t$, where*:
>+ t runs through a given set $T$ of nonnegative integers (such as: periods, date, time)
>+ $X_t$ is a representable measurable characteristic of the process (e.g. inventory level, queue length)

>[!info] Markovian property
>The conditional probability of any future event given any past event and the present state $X_t = i$, is independent of the past events and depends only on the present state:
