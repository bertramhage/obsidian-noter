Let $L$ be the lag operator and $y_t$ be a times series
$$Ly_t=y_{t-1}$$
$$L^{2}y_t=L(y_{t-1})=y_{t-2}$$
In general
$$
L^jy_t=y_{t-1}
$$
The lag operator is commutative and distributive.

## Differencing
Thus, first difference can be written as
$$
\Delta y_t=(1-L)y_t
$$
and second-order differences are represented as
$$
(y_t-y_{t-1})-(y_{t-1}-y_{t-2})=(1-L)^{2}y_t
$$
In general, a $d$th order difference is written as
$$
(1-L)^dy_t.
$$

#### Seasonal differencing
For seasonal differencing
$$
y_t-y_{t-s}=(1-L^s)y_t.
$$

## Lag operator in models
For the AR($p$) model $Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1Y_{t-1}+\cdots+\beta_pY_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t$
$$
(1-\beta_1L-\cdots-\beta_pL^p)Y_t=\beta_0+\varepsilon_t.
$$

For MA($q$) model $Y_t = c_0+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_t+\cdots+\theta_q\varepsilon_{t-q}$
$$
Y_t=c_0+(1+\theta_1L+\cdots+\theta_qL^q)\varepsilon_t.
$$

The ARIMA($p,d,q$) can be compactly written as
$$
\left(1-\beta_1 L-\cdots-\beta_p L^p\right)(1-L)^d Y_t=\beta_0+\left(1+\theta_1 L+\cdots+\theta_q L^q\right) \varepsilon_t
$$

The seasonal ARIMA($p,d,q$)($P,D,Q$)\[$s$\] involve Lag of seasonal period.
For example for $ARIMA(2,1,2)(1,1,1)[4]$ without a constant:
$$
(1-\beta_1L-\beta_2L^2)(1-\beta_1L^s)(1-L)(1-L^s)Y_t=(1-\theta_1L+t_2L^2)(1-\Theta_1L^s)\varepsilon_t
$$
where $B_1$ is an autoregressive coefficient on seasonal AR part and $\Theta_1$ is a moving average coefficient on seasonal MA part.
