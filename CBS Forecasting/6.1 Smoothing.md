Exponential smoothing provides a forecasting method most effective when the components (trend and seasonal factors) of the series change over time. For smoothing models we can expect prediction intervals to grow in size as the forecast horizon increases.

## Simple exponential smoothing
In simple exponential smoothing method, a point forecast at time $T$ of any value $Y_{T+h}$ is the last estimate $\ell_T$
$$
\hat{y}_{T+h}=\ell_T,
$$
where
$$
\ell_T = \alpha y_T+(1-\alpha)\ell_{T-1},\quad 0<\alpha<1
$$
We estimate the optimal $\alpha$ based on the data using R `HoltWinters()`.

## Holt-Winters' trend corrected exponential smoothing
The point forecast made in period $T$, for a forecast horizon $h$, for $y_{T+h}$ is
$$
\hat{y}_{T+h}=\ell_T+hb_{T},
$$
where
$$
\ell_T = \alpha y_T+(1-\alpha)[\ell_{T-1}+b_{T-1}]
$$
denotes the *level* at time $T$, and
$$
b_T=\beta[\ell_T-\ell_{T-1}]+(1-\beta)b_{T-1}
$$
denotes the *growth rate* at time $T$.
Here $a$ and $\beta$ are smoothing constants.

## Seasonal Holt-Winters'
Seasonal Holt-Winters' method is appropriate when a series has a linear trend with an additive seasonal pattern for which the level, the growth rate, and the seasonal pattern *may be changing*.

The point forecast made in period $T$, for a forecast horizon $h$, for $y_{T+h}$ is
$$
\hat{y}_{T+h}=\ell_T+hb_T+s_{T-L+h},
$$
where
$$
\ell_T = \alpha(y_T-s_{T-L})+(1-\alpha)[\ell_{T-1}+b_{T-1}],
$$
$$
b_T = \beta[\ell_T-\ell_{T-1}]+(1-\beta)b_{T-1},
$$
and the estimate of the seasonal factor in period $T$ is
$$
s_T = \gamma[y_T-\ell_T]+(1-\gamma)s_{T-L}.
$$
$\alpha,\beta,$ and $\gamma$ are smoothing constants.
