## Preparing data
``` R
require(forecast)

s <- 4 #Frequency of the data
styear <- 1962
datastart <- c(styear,1) #when your data starts: Q1 1962
fstart <- c(1994,1) #when your forecast starts: Q1 1994
T <- length(data) #set up the length of your data
#how many years your data will cover
years <- T/s #NOTE: works only if each year has a full set of seasonal observations

#Then turn the data into a time series so R can read it as time series:
data <- ts(data, frequency=s, start=datastart)
#Let's make a plot of employment versus time
plot(data)
```

## ACF/PACF
``` R
#I would like to set 8 last quarters (2 years) of data aside to evaluate
#the quality of the forecast. I will only use data up to 4th quarter 1993
#in estimation. So, instead of 136 data observations, I will use 128
#observations in estimation. The time series is long enough, so it should
#not harm the quality of the model.
h <- s*2
y <- subset(data, end=T-h); z <- subset(data, start=T-h+1)
plot(y)
acf(y)
pacf(y)
```

## MA models
``` R
#First, consider forecasting with MA(4) model. Re-estimate the model with
#shorter series:
model.ma <- arima(y,order=c(0,0,4))
model.ma

FIT.ma<-y-model.ma$residuals
#A quick forecast
forecast.ma<-forecast(model.ma, h=h)
forecast.ma #here is the insample forecast
plot(forecast.ma,ylab="Canadian employment",main="MA(4) model")
lines(data)
lines(FIT.ma,col="green")
```

## Auto ARMA
``` R
#Let's make sure that ARMA(2,1) is still the best of ARMA models
#for shorter data
model.arma <- auto.arima(y, d=0, seasonal = FALSE, ic = "aic",
stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE,
trace = TRUE)
#The AIC tells that the best approximation is ARMA(2,0), which is the same as AR(2).
#But ARMA(2,1) is still the best among the mixture ARMA models for this series.
model.arma<-arima(y,order=c(2,0,1))
model.arma

FIT.arma<-y-model.arma$residuals
forecast.arma<-forecast(model.arma, h=h)
forecast.arma #here is the insample forecast
plot(forecast.arma,ylab="Canadian employment",main="ARMA(2,1) model")
lines(data)
lines(FIT.arma,col="green")
```

## AR models
``` R
model.ar <- arima(y,order=c(2,0,0))
model.ar
FIT.ar<-y-model.ar$residuals
forecast.ar<-forecast(model.ar, h=h)
forecast.ar #here is the insample forecast
plot(forecast.ar,ylab="Canadian employment",main="AR(2) model")
lines(data)
lines(FIT.ar,col="green")
```

## Accuracy measures
``` R
# Compute the insample forecast accuracy measures
accuracy(forecast.ma,z)
accuracy(forecast.arma,z)
accuracy(forecast.ar,z)
```

## Forecast
``` R
#Re-estimate the chosen model on the full sample to construct an out of sample forecast
y<-data
h<-12
model.arma<-arima(y,order=c(2,0,1))
model.arma
acf(model.arma$residuals)
pacf(model.arma$residuals)

FIT.arma<-y-model.arma$residuals
forecast.arma<-forecast(model.arma, h=h)
forecast.arma #here is the out-of-sample forecast
plot(forecast.arma,ylab="Canadian employment",main="ARMA(2,1) model")
lines(FIT.arma,col="green")
```
