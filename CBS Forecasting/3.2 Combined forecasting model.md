**Additive model**
$$
y_t = T_t+S_t+C_t+\epsilon_t
$$
**Multiplicative model**
$$
\begin{align}
y_t &= Tr_t\times Sr_t\times Cr_t\times\epsilon_t\implies \\
\ln y_t &= \ln Tr_t+\ln Sn_t+\ln Cl_t + \ln\epsilon_t \\
&=T_t+S_t+C_t+\epsilon_t
\end{align}

## Trend
Start by considering trend. Can be linear or non-linear
$$
T_t = \beta_0+\beta_1Time_t
$$
$$
T_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1Time_t+\beta_2Time_t^{2}
$$

>We use a parabolic trend

>We see that both components are significant but second order term is very small.

## Seasonality
Consider whether seasonality appears. It could be from looking at the de-trended data plotted or using ACF and looking for recurrent spikes.

To handle season one way is to introduce dummies. Remember to either remove one dummy or intercept.

>Clearly seasonality is apparent.
>We introduce dummies for each month. As intercept is clearly a significant value (see very first plot) we exclude december.

## Cyclical component
Consider AR, MA or ARMA if ACF and/or PACF seems to have unaccounted for residuals.

Thus the full model becomes
$$
y_t = \mathbf{\beta}\mathbf{Time}_t+\sum_{j=1}^{n} \delta_jD_{jt}+\sum_{i=1}^{p} \rho \tilde{y}_{t-i}+\sum_{k=1}^{q} \theta_k+\epsilon_{t-k}+\epsilon_t \, 
$$
where $\beta$ and $\mathbf{Time_t}$ is a vector and $\epsilon_t\sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$.
$\tilde{y}$ is detrended and deseasonalized.

## Model validation
We consider various things qualitatively. 
- Some residuals are un-forecastable. Is the only residuals left un-forecastable? Look from ACF and PACF.
- Predict the future, how does the forecast look relative to the historic data
- Plot residuals to check assumption $\epsilon_t\sim WN(0, \sigma^{2})$

>Residuals look more or less normal distributed.
