## Seasonal lags
If seasonal data is not stationary you can take the seasonal difference
$$
z_t=y_t-y_{t-s},
$$
where $s$ is the number of seasons.

After a round of seasonal differences, test for Unit Root. If the data were not sufficiently stationary, then take an extra round of differencing. This time it will be first differences, since the seasonality is removed in the first round of seasonal differences.
$$
z_t = y_t-y_{t-1}-y_{t-s}+y_{t-s-1}.
$$
## Seasonal ARIMA
$$
ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[s]
$$
$s$ is the number of observations per year, $(p,d,q)$ is the order of non-seasonal part of the model and $(P,D,Q)$ is the order of the seasonal part of the model.

The seasonal part of the model consists of terms that are similar to the non-seasonal components of the model, but involve Lag of the seasonal period (see [[5.2 Lag operators]]).
