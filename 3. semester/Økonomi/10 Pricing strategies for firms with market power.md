## Basic pricing strategies

##### Given perfect information 
Select the quantity $Q$ that equates marginal revenue $MR$ and marginal cost $MC$ and charge the maximum price that consumer will pay for this level of output.

>[!example]+ Perfect information profit maximization
>Given the inverse demand function and cost function
>$$
>P=10-2Q, C(Q)=2Q
>$$
>Q: What is the profit maximizing level of output and price?
>
>A:
>- Marginal revenue: $MR=10-4Q$
>- Marginal cost: $MC = 2$
>- Equating these two functions: $10-4Q=2\implies Q=2\implies P=\$6$.

##### Incomplete information
Managers have a "crude" estimate of 
- Marginal cost
- The price elasticity of demand, since it is typically available for a representative firm.

>[!info] Simple pricing rule: Monopoly and monopolistic competition
>Given a marginal cost $MC$ and own elasticity of demand $E_F=\frac{\partial Q/Q}{\partial P/P}$ the monopoly and monopolistically competitive firm's profit-maximizing price (markup) is computed from
>$$
>MC = P\left[ \frac{1+E_F}{E_F} \right]=MR.
>$$
>Thus, set the price such that
>$$
>P=\left[ \frac{E_F}{1+E_F} \right]MC.
>$$

>[!example]+ Simple pricing rule problem
>A manager of a convecience store competes in a monopolistically competitive market.
>$MC$ for a cola is $\$1.25=\frac{5}{4}$ per liter.
>$E_F$ for cola is -4.
>Q: What price should the manager charge for a liter of cola to maximize profits?
>
>A:
>Markup factor is $\left[ \frac{-4}{1-4} \right] =\frac{4}{3}$.
>The profit-maximizing pricing rule is
>$$
>P=\left[ \frac{4}{3} \right]\left[ \frac{5}{4} \right]=\frac{5}{3}\approx \$1.67.

>When $N$ firms in a Cournot oligopoly has identical cost structures and produce similar products, the simple profit-maximizing price markup in Cournot equilibrium is

>P=\left[ \frac{NE_M}{1+NE_M} \right]MC,
>$$
>where $E_M$ is the market elasticity of demand.


## Models that extract surplus from consumers
Models that yield greater profits fall into three categories:
- Pricing strategies that extract surplus from consumers
- Pricing strategies for special cost and demand structures.
- Pricing strategies in markets with intense price competition.

##### Surplus extraction - Price discrimination

>The practice of charging different prices to consumers for the same good or service.

###### First degree price discrimination rule
Charging each consumer the max price he or she would be willing to pay.

###### Second degree
Posting a discrete schedule of declining prices for different ranges of quantity.

###### Third degree
Charging different prices based on systematic differences in demand across demographic consumer groups.

>[!info] Third degree price discrimination rule
>To maximize profits, a firm with market power produces the output at which the marginal revenue (left-hand side of the following equations) to each group equals marginal cost.
>$$
>P_1\left[ \frac{1+E_1}{E_1} \right]=MC
>$$
>$$
>P_2\left[ \frac{1+E_2}{E_2} \right]=MC
>$$

>[!example]+ Third degree price discrimination problem
>A manager in a pizzeria produces at a $MC=\$6$.
>The pizzeria is a local monopoly near campus, where, during the day only students eat there and in the evening faculty members eat there.
>Suppose students have an elasticity of demand of -4 and faculty members have an elasticity demand of -2.
>
>Q: What should your pricing policy be to maximize profits?
>
>A:
>It will be profitable to charge a "lunch menu" price and a "dinner menu" price. These prices are
>$$
>P_L\left[ \frac{1-4}{-4} \right]=\$6\implies P_L=\$8
>$$
>$$
>P_D\left[ \frac{1-2}{-2} \right]=\$6\implies P_D=\$12
>$$

##### Surplus extraction - Two-part pricing

>A pricing strategy whereby a firm with market power charges a fixed fee for the right to purchase its goods, plus a per-unit charge for each unit purchased.

![[Skærmbillede 2023-12-17 kl. 14.22.11.png]]
##### Surplus extraction - Block pricing

> A pricing strategy in which *identical* products are packaged together in order to enhance profits by forcing customers to make an all-or-none decision to purchase.

![[Skærmbillede 2023-12-17 kl. 14.23.12.png]]
##### Surplus extraction - Commodity bundling

> The practice of bundling several *different* products together and selling them at a single "bundle price."

##### Pricing strategies for special cost and demand structures

###### Peak-load pricing
> A pricing strategy in which higher prices are charged during peak hours than during off-peak hours.

![[Skærmbillede 2023-12-17 kl. 14.25.52.png]]
###### Cross-subsidies
> A pricing strategy in which profits gained from the sale of one product are used to subsidize sales of a related product.
> 
> Whenever the demands for two products produced by a firm are interrelated through costs or demand, the firm may enhance profits by cross-subsidization: selling one product at or below cost and the other product above cost.

###### Transfer pricing
> A pricing strategy in which a firm optimally sets the internal price at which an upstream division sells an input to a downstream devision.

##### Intense price competition - price matching

> A strategy in which a firm advertises a price and a primise to match any lower price offered by a competitor.

##### Intense price competition - Inducing brand loyalty

> Brand loyal customers continue to buy a firm's product even if another firm offers a slightly better price.

##### Intense price competition - Randomized pricing

> A strategy in which a firm intentionally varies its price in a attempt to "hide" price information from consumers and rivals.
