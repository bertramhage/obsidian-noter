## Employment rate
Denote:
$L$ = # of workers in labor force
$E$ = # of employed workers
$U$ = # of unemployed
$U/L$ = unemployment rate

>[!info] Steady state employment rate
>Assume $L$ is fixed. Denote
>$s$ = rate of job separation
>$f$ = rate of job finding
>$E$ = # of employees getting separated from their jobs
>$U$ = # of unemployed finding jobs
>Steady state:
>$$
>s \times E = f \times U

>Policy: reduce $s$ or increase $f$.

## Marginal product of labour
$W$ = nominal wage
$R$ = nominal rental rate
$P$ = price of output

Measured in units of output:
$W/P$ = real wage
$R/P$ = real rental rate

> Basic idea: a firm hires each unit of labour if the cost does not exceed the benefit.

## Consumption
**Disposable income**: total income minus tax: $Y-T$
**Consumption function**: $C = C(Y-T)$

>**Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)**: is the change in $C$ when disposable income increase by one dollar.

## Market of goods and services
Aggregate demand: $C(\bar{Y}-\bar{T})+I(r)+\bar{G}$
Aggregate supply: $\bar{Y}=F(\bar{K},\bar{L})$
Equilibrium: $\bar{Y}=C(\bar{Y}-\bar{T})+I(r)+\bar{G}$

## Loanable funds
![[Skærmbillede 2023-12-17 kl. 20.34.33.png]]
**Households:** Private saving = $(Y-T)-C$
**Government:** Public saving = $T-G$
- If $T>G$: budget surplus = $T-G$=public saving
- If $T<G$: Budget deficit = $G-T$ and public saving is negative
- If $T=G$: Balanced budget, public saving = 0

**National saving (S)** = private saving + public saving = $Y-C-G$

##### Loanable funds market equilibrium
