## 8 Inside Oligopoly
>[!info] Sustaining Cooperative Outcomes with Trigger Strategies
>Consider a infinitely repeated one-shot game with interest rate $i$. Denote the cooperative one-shot payoff to a player as $\pi^{Coop}$, the maximum one-shot payoff if the player cheats as $\pi^{Cheat}$ and the one-shot Nash equilibrium payoff as $\pi^N$. Assume that
>$$
> \frac{\pi^{Cheat}-\pi^{Coop}}{\pi^{Coop}-\pi^N}≤ \frac{1}{i}.
>$$
>Then the cooperative (collusive) outcome can be  sustained in the infinitely repeated game with the  following trigger strategy: “Cooperate provided that no  player has ever cheated in the past. If any player cheats,  “punish” the player by choosing the one-shot Nash equilibrium strategy forever after. 

## 9 Auctions
>[!info] Strategies for independent private value auctions
>With independant private values, bidders know his or her own values prior to the auction start.
>
>**English auction**
>Remain active until the price exceeds his or her own valuation of the item.
>
>**Second price, sealed-bid auction**
>Bid his or her own valuation of the item. This is a dominant strategy.
>
>**First-price, sealed-bid auction (strategically equivalent to the Dutch auction)**
>Bid less than his or her valuation of the item. Given $n$ bidders all perceiving valuations to be uniformly distributed between a lowest $L$ and highest $H$ possible valuation the optimal bid $b$ for a player whose own valuation $v$ is 
>$$
>b = v-\frac{v-L}{n}.
>$$

## 10 Pricing strategies
>[!info] Simple pricing rule: Monopoly and monopolistic competition
>Given a marginal cost $MC$ and elasticity of demand $E_F$ the monopoly and monopolistically competitive firm's profit-maximizing price (markup) is computed from
>$$
>MC = P\left[ \frac{1+E_F}{E_F} \right]=MR.
>$$
>Thus, set the price such that
>$$
>P=\left[ \frac{E_F}{1+E_F} \right]MC.
>$$

>[!info] Simple pricing rule for Cournot oligopoly
>When $N$ firms in a Cournot oligopoly has identical cost structures and produce similar products, the simple profit-maximizing price markup in Cournot equilibrium is
>$$
>P=\left[ \frac{NE_M}{1+NE_M} \right]MC,
>$$
>where $E_M$ is the market elasticity of demand.

>[!info] Third degree price discrimination rule
>To maximize profits, a firm with market power produces the output at which the marginal revenue (left-hand side of the following equations) to each group equals marginal cost.
>$$
>P_1\left[ \frac{1+E_1}{E_1} \right]=MC
>$$
>$$
>P_2\left[ \frac{1+E_2}{E_2} \right]=MC
>$$
