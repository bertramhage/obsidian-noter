## Quantity theory

##### Money demand
A simple money demand function
$$
(M/P)^d=kY,
$$
where
$k$ = how much money people wish to hold for each dollar of income.

$$
k = \frac{1}{V}
$$
##### Inflation rate $\pi$
$$
\pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P}=\frac{\Delta M}{M}-\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}
$$
>[!info] Inflation and interest rates
>Let $i$ denote nominal interest rate (not adjusted for inflation) and $r$ denote the real interest rate, adjusted for inflation
>$$
>r = i-\pi.
>$$

In a money demand function
$$
(M/P)^d = L(i,Y)$$
real money demand depends *negatively* on $i$ and *positively* on $Y$.

>[!info] Money demand equilibrium
>$$
>\frac{M}{P}=L(r+E_\pi,Y)
>$$
>For given values of $r, Y$ and $E_\pi$ a change in $M$ causes $P$ to change by the same percentage.

>**Classic dichotomy**: The theoretical separation of real and nominal variables in the classical model, which implies nominal variables do not affect real variables.

>**Neutrality of money**: Idea that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables. In the real world money is approximately neutral in the long run.

## Net export
Denote $e$ as the nominal exchange rate (the relative price of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency).
Denote $\varepsilon$ as the real exchange rate (the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods).

$NX = NX(\varepsilon)$, inverse relationship

$NX(\varepsilon) = \bar{S}-I(r^*)$
##### Nominal exchange rate
$e = \varepsilon \times \frac{P^*}{P}$
