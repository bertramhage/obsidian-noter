## Sweezy Oligopoly
- Few firms serving many consumers
- They produce **differentiated** products
- Believes its rivals will cut their prices in response to a price reduction but will not raise their prices in response to a price increase

## Cournot Oligopoly
- Few firms serving many consumers
- Either **differentiated** or **homogeneous** products
- Believes its rivals will hold their output constant if it changes it output $\implies$ Each firm's marginal revenue is impacted by the other firms output decision.

##### Reaction functions
The relationship between each firm’s profit-maximizing output level.

## Stachelberg Oligopoly
- Few firms serving many consumers
- Either **differentiated** or **homogeneous** products
- A single firm (the leader) chooses an output whereafter other firms (the followers) choose output that maximize profits given the leader's output.

## Bertrand Oligopoly
- Few firms serving many consumers
- Produce **identical** products at a constant marginal cost
- Firms engage in **price competition** and react optimally to prices charged by competitors

>**Bertrand Oligopoly: Equilibrium**
>The "price war" will come to an end when the price each firm charged equaled marginal cost ($P_{1}=P_{2}=MC$).
